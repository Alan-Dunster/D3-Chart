    <h1>Temperature and Air Quality in Cardiff</h1>

    <h3>The data presented in this visualisation clearly shows pollution levels increase as temperatures fall, 
      except for Ozone levels, which appear to do the opposite.</h3>
    
    <h3>Chart 1 shows the variation of the daily measures from their annual averges (0% baseline). 
      Comparing measures to a basline is useful when the scale range between some measures (i.e. Carbon Monoxide) 
      is too small to compare easily with others (i.e. Nitric Oxide). 
      Chart 2 represents the actual daily measures. Whilst the same trends can be observed by zoomimng in, 
      this chart is made available so the viewer can see both perspectives.</h3>
